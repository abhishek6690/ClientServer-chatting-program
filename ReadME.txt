This is a Client Server Program in Java.
I have used Socket programming feature in this code.

This is a simple chatting program in which client chats with server 
One of the program is Client and other is Server
The program terminates when Client say "bye".


This is how the program works:

1. Run MyServer. The program is waiting for a client. After the client is connected the program send: Hello !!
2. Run MyClient. This program receives The word: Hello !!.
The following steps are repeated until the client enters: bye.
Step I) Enter a message on the client’s console (Like: How are you server?) 
This message appears on the server’s console (like: How are you server?)
Step II) Enter a message on the server’s console (like: I am good. Do you have any question client?). 
This message appears on the client’s console (like: I am good. Do you have any question client?)
